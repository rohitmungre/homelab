## 1. What Is a Hosted Zone?

A **hosted zone** in Route 53 is simply a container for DNS records for a specific domain (for example, `example.com`). You create a hosted zone to tell AWS “I want Route 53 to answer DNS queries for this domain,” and then you add record sets (A, CNAME, MX, etc.) inside it to map names (subdomains, apex domain) to IPs, endpoints, mail servers, and so on.

## 2. Public vs. Private Hosted Zones

| Type        | Visibility                                        | Use Case                                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Public**  | Answers queries from anywhere on the Internet     | Hosting public websites, APIs, email routing, etc.           |
| **Private** | Answers queries only from within one or more VPCs | Internal services, microservice discovery, split-horizon DNS |

* **Public**: Delegate your domain at your registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.) to the NS records Route 53 gives you, and Route 53 becomes the global DNS authority for that domain.
* **Private**: Associate the zone with one or more VPCs. Only resources inside those VPCs can resolve names in that zone—ideal for internal-only endpoints (e.g. `db.internal.example.com`).

## 3. Core Components of a Hosted Zone

1. **Name Servers (NS) Record**

   * Automatically created when you make a hosted zone.
   * Four NS entries (e.g. `ns-123.awsdns-45.com`) you must configure at your domain registrar for public zones.

2. **Start of Authority (SOA) Record**

   * Automatically created once per zone; holds metadata like the zone’s primary name server, contact email (obfuscated), and serial number for zone changes.

3. **Resource Record Sets**

   * The records you add yourself:

     * **A / AAAA** → IPv4/IPv6 addresses
     * **CNAME** → alias one name to another
     * **MX** → mail exchangers
     * **TXT** → arbitrary text (SPF, DKIM, domain verification)
     * **Alias** → AWS-specific pointer to CloudFront distributions, S3 static sites, ELB load balancers, API Gateway, etc.
   * Each set has a **Name**, a **Type**, a **TTL** (time-to-live), and one or more values.

## 4. Creating & Managing a Hosted Zone

### Via the Console

1. Open **Route 53** → **Hosted zones** → **Create hosted zone**
2. Enter your domain name, choose Public or Private, and hit **Create**.
3. Copy the NS records (for public zones) to your registrar.

### Via the AWS CLI

```bash
# Public hosted zone
aws route53 create-hosted-zone \
  --name example.com \
  --caller-reference $(date +%s)

# Private hosted zone (assoc. to a VPC)
aws route53 create-hosted-zone \
  --name internal.example.com \
  --caller-reference $(date +%s) \
  --vpc VPCRegion=eu-west-1,VPCId=vpc-0123456789abcdef0 \
  --hosted-zone-config Comment="Private zone for internal services",PrivateZone=true
```

After creation, add record sets either in the console or with `aws route53 change-resource-record-sets …`.

## 5. Delegation & Registrar Configuration

* **Public zone**: at your domain registrar, replace existing nameservers with the four NS values from your hosted zone.
* **Private zone**: no registrar changes—DNS is automatically available to the VPCs you associated.

---

## 6. Common Use Cases

* **Static website hosting**: point your apex domain (`example.com`) via an Alias A-record to an S3 website endpoint or CloudFront distribution.
* **Load-balanced apps**: use Alias records to route `api.example.com` to an Application Load Balancer.
* **Email**: configure MX and TXT/SPF/DKIM records to verify and route mail via SES, Google Workspace, etc.
* **Service discovery**: private hosted zones for microservices within a VPC (e.g., `service-a.internal.example.com`).

---

## 7. Best Practices

* **Use Alias records** for AWS resources—no extra cost, TTL is managed by AWS.
* **Tag your hosted zones** (and record sets) to track cost allocation and ownership.
* **Enable DNS query logging** (for public zones) to CloudWatch or S3 to audit lookups.
* **Mind your quotas**: by default you can have up to 500 hosted zones per account (soft limit).
* **Rotate critical DNS changes** via Terraform, CloudFormation, or CDK to keep your zone definitions in version control.
